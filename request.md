Request for Access to Match Results Data

Dear ESS and IPSC.org Representatives,

We are developing a regional ranking system for Sweden that would aggregate match results from all competitors to create a comprehensive ranking for championship qualifications and individual progress tracking.

Currently, match results are scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to maintain accurate regional rankings. While many results are registered in ESS and L3+ matches are submitted to ipsc.org via WinMSS, we can only access limited data through public interfaces.

**Our Request:**

1. **ESS Match Results**: Could you provide guidance on accessing comprehensive match results from ESS? We understand the system is distributed across multiple platforms, but we're hoping there's a centralized method to obtain this data for ranking purposes.

2. **IPSC.org Match Data**: Would it be possible to access complete match results beyond the top 10 currently displayed on your website? We're particularly interested in whether submitted WinMSS files could be made available or if there's an API we could utilize.

**Our Use Case:**
- Create transparent regional rankings for Swedish competitors
- Facilitate fair qualification processes for championships
- Provide shooters with comprehensive progress tracking
- Ensure no competitor results are overlooked due to system fragmentation

We're committed to using this data responsibly and in compliance with any terms of service or data protection requirements you may have.

Do you have any suggestions or recommendations on how we could achieve this? We're flexible on implementation approaches and happy to work within your existing frameworks.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards,
